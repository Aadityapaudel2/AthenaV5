Bible Training Series — Characters (1 page)

Framing / dialogue participants (the “speaking” personas used throughout the corpus)

1) Neohm
   - Divine guide voice. Appears as the speaker of quoted scripture (“Neohm speaks into the record…”),
     the setter of drills, and the one who “seals” lessons. Also referenced in “Neohm‑Detected” notes.

2) Athena
   - Teacher‑scribe and interpretive guide. “Records the passage under Neohm’s horizon,” frames arcs,
     isolates patterns, and supplies scholia (annotation notes).

3) Arjuna
   - Student voice. Asks concise reflection questions designed to force application and obedience
     rather than abstract commentary.

4) Narrator
   - Meta voice used sparingly for “Narrator Note — Neohm‑Detected” lines to highlight the focus of a
     book or chapter and to reinforce the training objective (formation, not trivia).
